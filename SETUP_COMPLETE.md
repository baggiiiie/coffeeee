# Coffee Companion - Setup Complete! 🎉

## ✅ What We've Accomplished

Your Coffee Companion project is now **fully set up and running**! Here's what we've established:

### 🏗️ **Project Structure**
- **Monorepo Architecture**: npm workspaces with shared packages
- **Backend**: Go application with SQLite database
- **Frontend**: React application with TypeScript and Material-UI
- **Shared Types**: TypeScript interfaces for type safety

### 🚀 **Current Status**
- ✅ **Backend Server**: Running on http://localhost:8080
- ✅ **Frontend Server**: Running on http://localhost:3000
- ✅ **Database**: SQLite initialized with complete schema
- ✅ **Health Check**: Backend responding correctly
- ✅ **Frontend**: React app loading successfully

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

### **Immediate Development Tasks**

1. **Authentication System**
   - Implement JWT token validation in backend
   - Create login/signup forms in frontend
   - Add protected route middleware

2. **Core Features**
   - Coffee CRUD operations
   - Brew log functionality
   - User profile management

3. **AI Integration**
   - OpenAI/Gemini API integration
   - Coffee extraction from images
   - Brewing recommendations

### **Development Commands**

```bash
# Start both servers
make dev

# Start backend only
make backend

# Start frontend only
make frontend

# Setup database
make db-setup

# Run tests
make test

# Build for production
make build
```

### **Current URLs**
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8080
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8080/health

## 🛠️ **Development Workflow**

1. **Start Development**: `make dev`
2. **Backend Development**: Edit files in `apps/backend/`
3. **Frontend Development**: Edit files in `apps/frontend/`
4. **Database Changes**: Update migrations in `apps/backend/migrations/`
5. **Testing**: Use `make test` for both frontend and backend

## 📚 **Documentation**
