# Story 1.4: User Login & Authentication

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
As a registered user, I want to be able to log in to my account, so that I can access the application's features.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The frontend has a login page.
2. The backend exposes a `/login` endpoint that authenticates the user.
3. Upon successful login, the backend returns a JWT (JSON Web Token).
4. The frontend stores the JWT securely and uses it for subsequent requests.
5. After logging in, the user is redirected to a simple, authenticated "dashboard" page.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Frontend: Login page UI and flow (AC: 1, 5)
  - [x] Implement `LoginPage` with email and password fields using MUI [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#react-component-hierarchy]

  - [x] On success, store JWT and redirect to `/dashboard` [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-strategy]
- [x] Frontend: Auth state and token storage (AC: 4)
  - [x] Add `AuthContext` providing `login`, `logout`, and `isAuthenticated` using localStorage for the token [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-persistence]

## Dev Notes
The following guidance is extracted from architecture and PRD; no assumptions beyond cited sources.

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.3 adds user registration; login depends on users existing with securely stored password hashes and salts. Validate that registration flow is available or seed a test user for local testing. [Source: docs/stories/1.3.story.md]

### API Specifications
- Login endpoint defined as `POST /api/v1/auth/login` with body `{ "email", "password" }` returning `{ "token" }`. [Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md#user--authentication-endpoints]
- PRD references `/login`; implement per API spec under `/api/v1/auth/login` and document the discrepancy; optionally alias if required. [Source: docs/prd/epic-1-foundation-user-onboarding.md]

### Data Models
- User includes `Email`, `PasswordHash`, `PasswordSalt`, timestamps. Login verifies provided password against stored hash/salt. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#user-model]

### Backend Architecture
- Handlers under `internal/api/handlers` with routes in `internal/api/routes/routes.go`. Implement `AuthHandler.Login` and route `POST /api/v1/auth/login`. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#go-package-structure]
- Use password utilities in `internal/utils/password.go` to hash/verify passwords. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#go-package-structure]
- Generate JWT using `internal/utils/jwt.go` and configure via `Config.JWT` (secret, expiry). [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#configuration-management]
- Authentication middleware validates JWT for protected routes and sets user context. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#middleware-stack]

### Frontend Architecture
- Provide `AuthContext` for authentication state and functions; store tokens in `localStorage`. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-strategy]
- Public route `/login` renders `LoginPage`; on success redirect to `/dashboard`. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-strategy]
- Protected routes require `isAuthenticated`; redirect unauthenticated users to `/login`. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#route-guards]

### File Locations / Project Structure
- Backend: `apps/backend/internal/api/handlers/auth.go`, `apps/backend/internal/api/routes/routes.go`, `apps/backend/internal/utils/jwt.go`, `apps/backend/internal/utils/password.go`, `apps/backend/internal/services/auth_service.go`, `apps/backend/internal/repository/user_repository.go`. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#go-package-structure]
- Frontend: `apps/frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx`, `apps/frontend/src/context/AuthContext.tsx` (or similar), router setup in `App.tsx`. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#monorepo-organization]

### Testing Requirements
- Backend tests: authenticate valid user returns 200 with token; invalid credentials return 401; token contains expected claims (issuer, expiry) if specified. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#backend-testing]
- Frontend tests: form validation, API call on submit, token stored, redirect to dashboard. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#frontend-testing]

### Technical Constraints
- Tech stack: Go backend, JWT-based auth, React 18 + TypeScript frontend with tokens stored client-side. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

### Project Structure Notes
- Discrepancy: PRD uses `/login` while API spec uses `/api/v1/auth/login`. Implement API per spec; frontend route remains `/login`. Consider adding a backend alias `/api/v1/login` only if product requests parity with PRD wording. [Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md#user--authentication-endpoints]

## Testing
- Backend: Tests for successful login, wrong password, and unknown email; verify token issuance. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#backend-testing]
- Frontend: Test login form submit flow, token storage, and redirect to `/dashboard`. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#frontend-testing]

## QA Results
### Review Date: 2025-08-21

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Backend login handler validates method, parses JSON with `DisallowUnknownFields`, checks required fields, and verifies credentials. It now also validates email format via `net/mail.ParseAddress` (added during QA). On success, it issues an HS256 JWT with bounded expiry from config and returns a user payload. Middleware validates Bearer tokens and injects claims/user ID into context. Frontend `AuthContext` stores the token in `localStorage` and provides `login/logout`; `ProtectedRoute` guards routes. Overall implementation meets functional needs and has solid test coverage. Security posture has concerns due to salted SHA-256 for password hashing rather than a stronger KDF (bcrypt/Argon2) and lack of abuse protections (e.g., rate limiting).

### Refactoring Performed

- File: apps/backend/internal/api/handlers/auth.go
  - Change: Added server-side email format validation in `Login` using `net/mail.ParseAddress` to return 400 on malformed email.
  - Why: Defense-in-depth; consistent validation across auth flows and clearer client feedback.
  - How: Early check after presence validation; returns `invalid email format` with HTTP 400.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Clear early returns, consistent error statuses
- Project Structure: ✓ Matches documented handlers/routes/utils organization
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Backend tests cover success, wrong password, unknown email, invalid JSON/method; frontend tests cover submit and error states
- All ACs Met: ✓ Functionally yes; AC5 (redirect) is implemented but not explicitly asserted in tests

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Migrate password hashing to bcrypt or Argon2 (memory-hard KDF)
- [ ] Add request rate limiting and/or CAPTCHA on login to mitigate brute-force
- [ ] Consider HttpOnly cookie for token transport to reduce XSS token theft risk (requires CSRF strategy)
- [ ] Add structured logging around auth events (avoid sensitive data)
- [ ] Frontend test: assert navigation to `/dashboard` on successful login

### Security Review

Current hashing uses salted SHA-256, which is not a suitable password hashing KDF; recommend bcrypt/Argon2 via `golang.org/x/crypto`. No rate limiting on login path; consider adding before production. Token is stored in `localStorage`; acceptable for MVP with awareness of XSS risks—consider HttpOnly cookies for production.

### Performance Considerations

Auth path is lightweight; JWT creation and a single DB query per login. No immediate concerns.
