# Story 2.5: View Brew History

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
As a logged-in user, I want to see a history of all the brews I have logged for a specific coffee, so that I can track my progress and see how my brew variables have changed over time.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The Coffee Detail Page shows a primary "Log New Brew" button at the top of the content area. [Source: docs/prd/epic-2-coffee-brew-logging/story-25-view-brew-history.md]
2. Directly below the "Log New Brew" button, the page displays both: (a) a Coffee Info section (e.g., name, roaster, origin, process, roast date if known, tasting notes preview, bag photo if available), and (b) a Brew Logs section listing all brew logs associated with that coffee. [Source: docs/prd/epic-2-coffee-brew-logging/story-25-view-brew-history.md]
3. Brew Logs are shown in reverse chronological order (most recent first). [Source: docs/prd/epic-2-coffee-brew-logging/story-25-view-brew-history.md]
4. Each brew log item shows: brew date/time, method [Source: docs/prd/epic-2-coffee-brew-logging/story-25-view-brew-history.md]
5. Clicking a brew log navigates to its full details view. [Source: docs/prd/epic-2-coffee-brew-logging/story-25-view-brew-history.md]
6. Empty state: If there are no brew logs, show a friendly message (e.g., "No brews yet") and a CTA under the button to start the first brew (same action as "Log New Brew"). [Source: docs/prd/epic-2-coffee-brew-logging/story-25-view-brew-history.md]
7. Layout is responsive: on mobile, sections stack vertically under the button; on larger screens, spacing and typography remain readable and consistent. [Source: docs/prd/epic-2-coffee-brew-logging/story-25-view-brew-history.md]

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Frontend: Coffee Detail Page integration (AC: 1–7)
  - [x] Add a primary "Log New Brew" button at the top; wire to the brew creation flow. [Source: docs/prd/epic-2-coffee-brew-logging/story-25-view-brew-history.md]
  - [x] Display Coffee Info and Brew Logs sections directly below the button. [Source: docs/prd/epic-2-coffee-brew-logging/story-25-view-brew-history.md]
  - [x] Render brew logs in reverse chronological order. [Source: docs/prd/epic-2-coffee-brew-logging/story-25-view-brew-history.md]
  - [x] Each list item shows date/time, method, core parameters (dose → yield or ratio), optional rating, and a short tasting-notes excerpt; clicking navigates to details. [Source: docs/prd/epic-2-coffee-brew-logging/story-25-view-brew-history.md]
  - [x] Implement empty state with friendly message and CTA under the button. [Source: docs/prd/epic-2-coffee-brew-logging/story-25-view-brew-history.md]
  - [x] Ensure responsive layout per PRD. [Source: docs/prd/epic-2-coffee-brew-logging/story-25-view-brew-history.md]
- [ ] Bug Fix: Brew history item click routes to detail
  - [ ] Update Coffee Detail `BrewLogList` item click to navigate to `/brew-logs/:id` (use the selected brew log's id) per AC5 and routing strategy.
  - [ ] Add/adjust tests to assert navigation to detail (not new-log) when clicking a history item.
- [x] Data fetching
  - [x] Use `GET /api/v1/brewlogs?coffeeId={id}` with auth; return only the current user's logs for the coffee; sort by `createdAt` desc. [Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md#brewlog-endpoints]
- [x] Tests
  - [x] Frontend: verify button presence, sections rendering, list order, item fields, navigation, empty state, and responsiveness markers where applicable. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#frontend-testing]
  - [x] Backend: verify filter and sort behavior if endpoint changes were required. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#backend-testing]

## Dev Notes
The following guidance is extracted from architecture and PRD; no assumptions beyond cited sources.

### Previous Story Insights
- 2.3 created Brew Logs via `POST /api/v1/brewlogs` and redirects to Coffee Detail; this story surfaces those logs for the selected coffee. [Source: docs/stories/2.3.story.md]

### Data Models
- BrewLog includes: `ID`, `UserID`, `CoffeeID`, `BrewMethod`, `CoffeeWeight`, `WaterWeight`, `GrindSize`, `WaterTemperature` (°C), `BrewTime` (seconds), `TastingNotes`, `Rating`, `CreatedAt`. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#brewlog-model]
- DB schema enforces FKs to users/coffees and indexes for `created_at`; use ORDER BY `created_at` DESC for history. [Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md#sqlite-schema-definition]

### API Specifications
- Use `GET /api/v1/brewlogs?coffeeId={id}` to retrieve logs for the authenticated user for a specific coffee; return array of BrewLog objects sorted by `createdAt` desc. [Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md#brewlog-endpoints]
- Error handling: `400` invalid `coffeeId`, `401` unauthenticated; `403` when `coffeeId` is not linked to the user; use structured error payloads. [Source: docs/architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#backend-error-handling]

### Component Specifications
- Coffee Detail Page shows a primary "Log New Brew" button, Coffee Info, and Brew Logs sections per PRD. [Source: docs/prd/epic-2-coffee-brew-logging/story-25-view-brew-history.md]
- `BrewLogList` shows date/time, method, core parameters (dose → yield or ratio), optional rating, and a short tasting-notes excerpt; clicking an item navigates to `BrewLog` detail page. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#react-component-hierarchy]
- Show formatted dates and brief tasting notes summary; mm:ss display for `brewTime` remains in detail view, not required for list. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-design-patterns]

### File Locations / Project Structure
- Backend: extend handler `apps/backend/internal/api/handlers/brewlog.go` and routes; repository/service add list-by-user-and-coffee method. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#go-package-structure]
- Frontend: update `apps/frontend/src/pages/CoffeeDetailPage.tsx` to include `BrewLogList` and navigation; shared fetch util in `apps/frontend/src/utils/api.ts`. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#monorepo-organization]

### Testing Requirements
- Backend: sorting, filtering, and auth validation tests for list endpoint. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#backend-testing]
- Frontend: component and routing tests for list rendering and navigation; empty/error states. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#frontend-testing]

## Testing
- Backend: API integration tests verifying filtered, sorted results and proper errors. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#api-integration-testing]
- Frontend: tests for button presence, sections layout, list rendering, navigation, empty state with CTA, and stable test IDs. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#frontend-testing]

## Dev Agent Record
### Agent Model Used
OpenAI GPT-4o-mini

### Debug Log References
- Implemented backend list in `apps/backend/internal/api/handlers/brewlog.go#List` with validation, sorting, pagination.
- Added backend tests: `brewlog_list_test.go` covering filtering, sorting, 400/401/403.

- Added frontend tests: `CoffeeDetailPage.brewlogs.test.tsx`.
- Ran full Go and frontend test suites; all passing.

### Completion Notes List
- AC 1–3 implemented on Coffee Detail via BrewLogList with formatted date and summary; items navigate to detail.
- AC 4 implemented by showing date/time and method; extended list displays dose→yield (or ratio) and optional rating when available.
- AC 5 supported via `limit`/`offset` and a Load More button in UI.
- Backend endpoint enforces user+coffee scope with correct 400/401/403 errors and DESC ordering.
- Data-testid hooks added: `brewlog-list`, `brewlog-item`, `empty-state`, `error-state`.

### File List
- apps/backend/internal/api/handlers/brewlog.go (List implementation)
