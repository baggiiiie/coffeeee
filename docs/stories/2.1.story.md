# Story 2.1: Create Coffee "Journey" Log

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
As a logged-in user, I want to add a new coffee to my personal collection by uploading a photo of the bag and adding details, so that I can keep a record of all the coffees I have tried.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The authenticated dashboard has a button to "Add New Coffee." [Source: docs/prd/epic-2-coffee-brew-logging.md#story-21-create-coffee-"journey"-log]
2. The "Add New Coffee" page has fields for coffee name, roaster, origin, etc., and a file upload for the bag photo. [Source: docs/prd/epic-2-coffee-brew-logging.md#story-21-create-coffee-"journey"-log]
3. The backend exposes `POST /api/v1/users/me/coffees` to find-or-create a coffee owned by the authenticated user. The uploaded photo path is stored on the coffee record, and the response returns the coffee object. [Source: docs/prd/epic-2-coffee-brew-logging.md#story-21-create-coffee-"journey"-log] [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#api-organization]
4. (Stretch) The backend sends the uploaded photo to an AI service to attempt to extract text and pre-fill the form fields. [Source: docs/prd/epic-2-coffee-brew-logging.md#story-21-create-coffee-"journey"-log]

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Frontend: Add dashboard Quick Action (AC: 1)
  - [x] Add an "Add New Coffee" button in `Dashboard` quick actions linking to the new coffee form route. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#react-component-hierarchy]
- [x] Frontend: New Coffee Form page (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create `apps/frontend/src/pages/CoffeeNewPage.tsx` with fields: name (required), roaster (optional), origin (optional), description (optional), photo upload control. [Source: docs/architecture/components.md#frontend-components-pagesviews] [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#coffee-model]
  - [x] Validate name non-empty; limit inputs according to model constraints (e.g., name <= 255). [Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md#sqlite-schema-definition]
  - [x] On submit, POST JSON to `/api/v1/users/me/coffees`; handle success/error toasts. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#api-organization] [Source: docs/architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]
  - [x] Include `data-testid` attributes for fields and submit button. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#frontend-testing]
- [x] Backend: User-owned coffee creation (AC: 3)
  - [x] Define ownership directly on `coffees` via `user_id` FK to `users(id)`; store `photo_path` on `coffees`. [Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md#sqlite-schema-definition]
  - [x] Implement handler `POST /api/v1/users/me/coffees` to accept `{ "name", "origin"?, "roaster"?, "description"?, "photoPath"? }`.

- [x] Photo upload handling (AC: 2, 4) — Project constraint note
  - [x] Provide client-side file input and preview only; file storage not defined in MVP tech stack. Record constraint in Dev Notes. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
  - [ ] If implementing stretch: send image to backend AI extraction endpoint for text extraction, or disable as non-blocking UI affordance. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#api-organization] [Source: docs/architecture/external-apis.md#ai-service-for-tasting-notes--brewing-suggestions]
- [x] Tests (AC: 1–3)
  - [x] Frontend: component tests for validation and submission success/error states. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#frontend-testing]
  - [x] Backend: integration test for `POST /api/v1/users/me/coffees` happy path and validation errors. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#api-integration-testing]

## Dev Notes
The following guidance is extracted from architecture and PRD; no assumptions beyond cited sources.

### Previous Story Insights
- Authenticated routing and JWT-protected endpoints are established for profile operations; reuse the protected subrouter and AuthContext patterns for authenticated coffee creation. [Source: docs/stories/1.9.story.md] [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#middleware-stack] [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-strategy]

### Data Models
- Coffee model fields: `Name` (required), `Origin` (optional), `Roaster` (optional), `Description` (optional), timestamps. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#coffee-model]
- Ownership is direct: `coffees.user_id` references `users.id`; `coffees.photo_path` stores the per-coffee photo path. No `user_coffees` join table. [Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md#database-relationships]

### API Specifications
- User collection endpoint: `POST /api/v1/users/me/coffees` to find-or-create an owned coffee; request `{ "name", "origin"?, "roaster"?, "description"?, "photoPath"? }`, response Coffee (owned by caller). [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#api-organization]
- Error handling must use structured error responses with clear messages for validation failures. [Source: docs/architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#backend-error-handling]

### Component Specifications
- Add Quick Action button on Dashboard; implement a dedicated New Coffee form page within protected routes. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#react-component-hierarchy]
- Use Material-UI components; responsive design via MUI breakpoints. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#styling-architecture]

### File Locations / Project Structure
- Backend: `apps/backend/internal/api/handlers/coffee.go`, `apps/backend/internal/api/routes/routes.go`, service/repository layers under `internal/services` and `internal/repository`. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#go-package-structure]
- Frontend: `apps/frontend/src/pages/CoffeeNewPage.tsx` (new), potential additions to `apps/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` quick actions, shared API util in `apps/frontend/src/utils/`. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#monorepo-organization]

### Testing Requirements
- Frontend: Jest + React Testing Library component tests covering validation rules, submission success/error, and presence of `data-testid` markers. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#frontend-testing]
- Backend: API integration tests for `POST /api/v1/users/me/coffees` verifying `201` on success and `400` on invalid input. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#api-integration-testing]

### Technical Constraints
- MVP tech stack lists File Storage as N/A; server-side file upload/storage is not defined. Treat photo upload as UI-only preview or defer storage; document as constraint. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- AI extraction is optional; backend includes `/api/v1/ai/extract-coffee` route in architecture for future integration. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#api-organization] [Source: docs/architecture/external-apis.md]

### Project Structure Notes
- Ensure new files align with source tree conventions for pages/components. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#monorepo-organization]
- Ownership model: coffees are owned directly (`coffees.user_id`), and the user-specific endpoint returns owned coffees; file storage strategy and AI extraction remain follow-ups.

### Revision Note — 2025-08-22
Story 2.7 updates the ownership model to use `coffees.user_id` and removes the `user_coffees` join table. Any references in this document to a join table or migration 002 are superseded; see Story 2.7 and the updated database schema for current implementation details. The acceptance criteria above reflect the updated model.

## Testing
- Frontend: unit/component tests for the New Coffee form validation and submission flows. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#frontend-testing]
- Backend: integration tests for coffee creation endpoint covering success and validation errors. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#api-integration-testing]
