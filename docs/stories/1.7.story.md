# Story 1.7: Current User Endpoint & Frontend Hydration

## Status
Draft

## Story
As an authenticated user, I want the app to load my profile on startup, so that my session is restored and the UI reflects my authenticated state without having to log in again.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Backend endpoint `GET /api/v1/users/me` returns the authenticated user's profile when provided a valid JWT and `401` when unauthenticated.
   - 200 response body includes exactly: `id` (number), `username` (string), `email` (string), `createdAt` (ISO 8601 string), `updatedAt` (ISO 8601 string).
   - 401 on missing/invalid/expired token, using structured error body.
   - 404 if the referenced user does not exist.
   - Response header: `Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8`

2. Frontend hydration: On app start, if a token exists in `localStorage['authToken']`, the app calls `GET /api/v1/users/me` and sets `AuthContext.user` and `isAuthenticated` accordingly.
   - On success: `user` populated; `isAuthenticated=true`.
   - On 401/invalid: token is cleared, `user=null`, `isAuthenticated=false`.

3. Authorization header: All authenticated requests include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` via a centralized Axios instance/module; 401 responses auto-trigger logout per Story 1.5.

4. UI reflects hydration: The header shows authenticated state (e.g., Logout visible) after successful hydration and hides it when unauthenticated.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Backend: Implement `GET /api/v1/users/me` (AC: 1)
  - [ ] In `apps/backend/internal/api/handlers/user.go#GetProfile`, read user ID from request context (populated by JWT middleware, Story 1.6)
  - [ ] Query DB for the user and return JSON `{ id, username, email, createdAt, updatedAt }` with `Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8`
  - [ ] Handle: missing context → 401, not found → 404, DB errors → 500 using structured error body
  - [ ] Example 200 response shape:
    ```json
    {"id":1,"username":"testuser","email":"test@example.com","createdAt":"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z","updatedAt":"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
    ```
  [Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md#user--authentication-endpoints] [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#middleware-stack] [Source: docs/architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#backend-error-handling]
- [ ] Backend: Ensure route wiring (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Confirm `protected.HandleFunc("/users/me", userHandler.GetProfile).Methods("GET")` is enabled under protected subrouter (already present)
  [Source: apps/backend/internal/api/routes/routes.go]
- [ ] Backend: Context key guidance (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Use a dedicated key type, for example:
    ```go
    type contextKey string
    const contextKeyUserID contextKey = "userID"
    // retrieval in handlers:
    userIDVal := r.Context().Value(contextKeyUserID)
    ```
  [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#middleware-stack]
- [ ] Frontend: API module and Authorization header (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create `apps/frontend/src/utils/api.ts` Axios instance with base URL and `Authorization` header injection when token exists
  - [ ] Add response interceptor to trigger `logout()` on `401` (Story 1.5 alignment)
  [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#route-guards]
- [ ] Frontend: AuthContext hydration on boot (AC: 2)
  - [ ] In `apps/frontend/src/context/AuthContext.tsx`, on mount read `localStorage['authToken']`
  - [ ] If present, set header via API module and call `GET /api/v1/users/me`; on success populate `user`, set `isAuthenticated=true`; on 401 clear token and remain unauthenticated
  - [ ] Ensure `login()` stores token to `localStorage['authToken']` (align with Story 1.5) and sets header for subsequent calls
  [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-persistence] [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-strategy]
- [ ] Frontend: Header state and testability (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Ensure `Header` uses `useAuth()` to conditionally render Logout and/or user identifier post-hydration
  - [ ] Add `data-testid="logout-button"` to the Logout control for stable test targeting
  [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#react-component-hierarchy]
- [ ] Tests (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
  - [ ] Backend integration tests: `/users/me` returns 200 with valid token and 401 without/invalid; 404 when user missing
  - [ ] Frontend tests: hydration success populates `user` and shows Logout; 401 path clears token and hides Logout; assert `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header is present on the hydration request

## Dev Notes
The following guidance is extracted from architecture and prior stories; no assumptions beyond cited sources.

### Dependencies
- Depends on Story 1.6 (JWT middleware) for context-based authentication and 401 handling.
- Depends on Story 1.5 for logout behavior and centralized 401 auto-logout via Axios interceptor.
  [Source: docs/stories/1.6.story.md] [Source: docs/stories/1.5.story.md]

### LocalStorage Key Alignment (Migration)
- Standardize the token key to `authToken` (Story 1.5). Update existing code that currently uses `localStorage.getItem('token')` to use `authToken`. During implementation, remove the legacy `token` key if present to avoid confusion.
  [Source: docs/stories/1.5.story.md]

### Backend Architecture & Organization
- Protected routes already define `/users/me` under the protected subrouter using `AuthMiddleware(cfg.JWT.Secret)`. Implement profile retrieval in `UserHandler.GetProfile`. [Source: apps/backend/internal/api/routes/routes.go] [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#middleware-stack]
- Use structured error responses for 401/404/500 as per error handling strategy. [Source: docs/architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#backend-error-handling]

### Frontend Architecture
- Tokens are persisted in localStorage; hydration should read from `localStorage['authToken']` to align with Story 1.5 and set the Authorization header for requests. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-persistence]
- Centralize API concerns in `src/utils/api.ts` with Axios interceptors for 401 auto-logout. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#route-guards]
- `Header` and route guards (`ProtectedRoute`) reflect `isAuthenticated` state post-hydration. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#react-component-hierarchy] [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#route-guards]

### File Locations / Project Structure
- Backend: `apps/backend/internal/api/handlers/user.go`, `apps/backend/internal/api/routes/routes.go`
- Frontend: `apps/frontend/src/context/AuthContext.tsx`, `apps/frontend/src/components/Header.tsx`, `apps/frontend/src/utils/api.ts`
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#monorepo-organization]

### Testing Requirements
- Backend: token validation path coverage, JSON response shape assertions, error codes.
- Frontend: mock API for `/users/me`, assert state changes, header injection, and UI conditions.
[Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#backend-testing] [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#frontend-testing]

### Technical Constraints
- Go backend with JWT middleware; React 18 + TypeScript frontend; Axios available for interceptors. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

## Testing
- Backend: integration tests for `/users/me` across valid/invalid/expired tokens and missing user scenario. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#backend-testing]
- Frontend: tests for hydration success and 401-triggered logout; ensure Authorization header is applied to requests post-hydration. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#frontend-testing]
