# Story 1.1: Project Setup & "Hello World"

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a developer, I want to set up the monorepo with the React frontend and Go backend projects, and a simple CI/CD pipeline, so that I have a stable foundation for development and a clear path to deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new Git repository is created.
2. The repository contains `frontend` and `backend` directories.
3. The `frontend` directory contains a basic React application.
4. The `backend` directory contains a basic Go application with an HTTP server.
5. The backend exposes a `/health` endpoint that returns a `200 OK` status.
6. A basic CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) is configured to run on every push.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Initialize monorepo structure (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Ensure workspace root contains `package.json` and `go.mod` per source tree [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Monorepo Organization]
  - [ ] Create `apps/frontend` and `apps/backend` folders matching structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Monorepo Organization]
- [ ] Scaffold basic React app with Vite (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Configure React 18 + TypeScript project under `apps/frontend/` [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]
  - [ ] Include initial pages (`LandingPage`, `LoginPage`, `SignUpPage`) and `App` shell [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#React Component Hierarchy]
- [ ] Scaffold Go HTTP server (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create server entrypoint under `apps/backend/cmd/server/main.go` [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#Go Package Structure]
  - [ ] Add basic router and middleware scaffolding under `internal/api` [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#API Organization]
- [ ] Implement `/health` endpoint (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Add handler `internal/api/handlers/health.go` returning 200 with minimal payload [Source: architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md#Health Checks]
  - [ ] Wire route in `internal/api/routes/routes.go` [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#API Organization]
- [ ] Configure basic CI (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Add GitHub Actions workflow to install Node + Go, run `npm ci`, `go build`, and tests [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#Development Process]
  - [ ] Ensure lint/format steps per coding standards are run [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#General Principles]
- [ ] Testing setup and smoke tests
  - [ ] Frontend: add Jest + React Testing Library config and one render test for `App` [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#Frontend Testing]
  - [ ] Backend: add Go `testing` package smoke test for `/health` [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#Backend Testing]

## Dev Notes
The following implementation guidance is extracted only from architecture documents. No assumptions beyond cited sources.

### Previous Story Insights
- No previous story. This is the first in the epic.

### Data Models
- No specific data models required for 1.1. User/Coffee/BrewLog models exist for later stories. [Source: architecture/data-models.md#User Model] [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Coffee Model] [Source: architecture/data-models.md#BrewLog Model]

### API Specifications
- For 1.1, only `/health` is required; broader API spec covers auth/users/coffees/brewlogs for later epics. [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#API Organization] [Source: architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md#Health Checks] [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#User & Authentication Endpoints]

### Component Specifications (Frontend)
- Initial pages and common components are defined; ensure `App` with Router and public routes (`/`, `/login`, `/signup`) exists. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#React Component Hierarchy] [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Routing Strategy]

### File Locations / Project Structure
- Monorepo layout with `apps/frontend` and `apps/backend`; shared packages under `packages/`. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Monorepo Organization]
- Backend structure with `cmd/server/main.go`, `internal/api/{handlers,middleware,routes}`, `internal/config`, `internal/database`. [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#Go Package Structure]
- Frontend with `src/main.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/pages`, `src/components`, `src/context`. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Monorepo Organization]

### Technical Constraints
- Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript, Vite bundler, MUI + Emotion. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]
- Backend: Go 1.22.x, `net/http` standard library for REST API. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]

### Testing Requirements
- Follow testing pyramid; unit tests predominant, basic smoke tests acceptable for 1.1. [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#Testing Pyramid]
- Frontend: Jest + React Testing Library for component tests. [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#Frontend Testing]
- Backend: Go `testing` for unit/integration; include API test for `/health`. [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#Backend Testing]

### Security/Performance Notes
- None special for 1.1; add logging and structured error handling as code scaffolds later. [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#Logging Strategy]

### Project Structure Notes
- The defined structure aligns with the source tree; no conflicts found. If repo already conforms, this story validates presence and minimal functionality rather than creating anew. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Monorepo Organization]

## Testing
- Frontend: Add and run a basic render test for the root `App` to ensure the app boots without errors. [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#Frontend Testing]
- Backend: Add `/health` handler test returning 200 JSON payload; run via `go test`. [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#Backend Testing]
