# Story 1.1: Project Setup & "Hello World"

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
As a developer, I want to set up the monorepo with the React frontend and Go backend projects, and a simple CI/CD pipeline, so that I have a stable foundation for development and a clear path to deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new Git repository is created.
2. The repository contains `frontend` and `backend` directories.
3. The `frontend` directory contains a basic React application.
4. The `backend` directory contains a basic Go application with an HTTP server.
5. The backend exposes a `/health` endpoint that returns a `200 OK` status.
6. A basic CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) is configured to run on every push.

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes
The following implementation guidance is extracted only from architecture documents. No assumptions beyond cited sources.

### Previous Story Insights
- No previous story. This is the first in the epic.

### Data Models
- No specific data models required for 1.1. User/Coffee/BrewLog models exist for later stories. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#user-model] [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#coffee-model] [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#brewlog-model]

### API Specifications
- For 1.1, only `/health` is required; broader API spec covers auth/users/coffees/brewlogs for later epics. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#api-organization] [Source: docs/architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md#health-checks] [Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md#user--authentication-endpoints]

### Component Specifications (Frontend)
- Initial pages and common components are defined; ensure `App` with Router and public routes (`/`, `/login`, `/signup`) exists. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#react-component-hierarchy] [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-strategy]

### File Locations / Project Structure
- Monorepo layout with `apps/frontend` and `apps/backend`; shared packages under `packages/`. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#monorepo-organization]
- Backend structure with `cmd/server/main.go`, `internal/api/{handlers,middleware,routes}`, `internal/config`, `internal/database`. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#go-package-structure]
- Frontend with `src/main.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/pages`, `src/components`, `src/context`. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#monorepo-organization]

### Technical Constraints
- Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript, Vite bundler, MUI + Emotion. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Backend: Go 1.22.x, `net/http` standard library for REST API. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

### Testing Requirements
- Follow testing pyramid; unit tests predominant, basic smoke tests acceptable for 1.1. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#testing-pyramid]
- Frontend: Jest + React Testing Library for component tests. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#frontend-testing]
- Backend: Go `testing` for unit/integration; include API test for `/health`. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#backend-testing]

### Security/Performance Notes
- None special for 1.1; add logging and structured error handling as code scaffolds later. [Source: docs/architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#logging-strategy]

### Project Structure Notes
- The defined structure aligns with the source tree; no conflicts found. If repo already conforms, this story validates presence and minimal functionality rather than creating anew. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#monorepo-organization]

## Testing
- Frontend: Add and run a basic render test for the root `App` to ensure the app boots without errors. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#frontend-testing]
- Backend: Add `/health` handler test returning 200 JSON payload; run via `go test`. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#backend-testing]

## QA Results

Review Summary:
- Scope: Monorepo setup, React app skeleton, Go HTTP server with /health, and basic CI pipeline.
- Depth: Standard review with targeted deep-dive due to backend test failures discovered in CI scope.

Gate Decision: CONCERNS
- Reason: Backend CI tests fail in the migrate package; core AC are implemented, frontend tests pass, and /health works as specified.

Requirements Traceability (AC → Evidence):
- AC1 (Git repo): Repository initialized; project under version control ('.git' present).
- AC2 (Frontend & Backend dirs): `apps/frontend` and `apps/backend` exist with expected structure.
- AC3 (Basic React app): Vite React TS app present; `App` and public routes; smoke test exists and passes.
- AC4 (Basic Go app/HTTP server): Server entrypoint at `apps/backend/cmd/server/main.go`; router configured; builds successfully (`go build ./...`).
- AC5 (/health endpoint 200): Route wired in `internal/api/routes/routes.go`; handler in `internal/api/handlers/health.go`; unit test `health_test.go` asserts 200 and payload.
- AC6 (CI/CD configured): GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs lint, build, and tests on push/PR.

Risk Assessment:
- Flags triggering deeper look: CI includes `go test ./...` which runs unrelated migrate tests, currently failing.
- Overall risk: Low-to-Medium for this story’s scope; main risk is CI instability from migrate package.

Test Architecture Assessment:
- Frontend: Vitest + RTL configured; single render test for `App` is appropriate at this stage.
- Backend: Handler-level test for `/health` is adequate for 1.1. Consider adding a router-level integration test using `httptest` in a future story.
- CI: Steps are correctly sequenced; however, backend tests include packages beyond this story’s scope.

Code Quality Notes:
- `HealthCheck` returns a hardcoded timestamp (non-blocking for 1.1). Consider using current time or omitting field until needed.
- Project structure aligns with architecture docs; separate Go module under `apps/backend` is correctly configured.

NFR Snapshot (for 1.1 scope):
- Security: N/A at this stage (no auth flows in scope).
- Performance: N/A (simple endpoint).
- Reliability: Basic handler and route in place; minimal surface.
- Maintainability: Code is readable; tests and CI present.

Testability Evaluation:
- Controllability: High (simple inputs; unit tests straightforward).
- Observability: High (JSON response; can assert status/payload).
- Debuggability: High (small surface, clear layering).

Technical Debt / Improvements:
- Backend CI instability due to migrate tests failing: migration runner naively splits SQL by semicolons; SQLite trigger statements contain internal semicolons, causing "incomplete input" and failures; also no `*.down.sql` present.
- Recommend either fixing the migration runner and adding proper `001_initial_schema.up.sql`/`001_initial_schema.down.sql`, or temporarily scoping CI tests to API packages until migrations are implemented in their dedicated story.

Recommendations:
- Must-fix before merging this story to main: Ensure backend CI is green by (a) adjusting CI to run only API handler/router tests for this story, OR (b) fixing migration tests (preferred if quick to address).
- Nice-to-have: Add a simple router integration test for `/health` using the configured mux router.

Suggested Next Status: Address concerns above, then Ready for Merge.

Evidence (local runs):
- Frontend tests: pass (`npm test --workspace=apps/frontend -- --run`).
- Backend build: pass (`cd apps/backend && go build ./...`).
- Backend tests: failing in `internal/migrate` (outside 1.1 scope).

### Review Date: 2025-08-19

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Implementation still meets Story 1.1 scope. Frontend scaffolding and smoke test pass; backend `/health` handler test passes. Backend migration tests continue to fail locally due to naive SQL splitting that breaks SQLite trigger statements. This is beyond 1.1 ACs but affects CI stability if backend tests are run repo-wide.

### Refactoring Performed

None in this review. Recommendations only.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓
- Project Structure: ✓
- Testing Strategy: ✓ (appropriate smoke coverage for 1.1)
- All ACs Met: ✓

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Make migration runner robust to semicolons within `BEGIN ... END` trigger bodies (or avoid splitting on `;` for SQLite)
- [ ] Ensure all migrations follow `.up.sql`/`.down.sql` naming; remove stray `001_initial_schema.sql` or convert it
- [ ] If deferring runner fix, scope backend CI tests to API packages for this story
- [ ] Add router-level integration test for `/health`

### Security Review

No auth or sensitive data in scope; no issues found.

### Performance Considerations

Not applicable for simple health endpoint.
