# Story 1.1: Project Setup & "Hello World"

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
As a developer, I want to set up the monorepo with the React frontend and Go backend projects, and a simple CI/CD pipeline, so that I have a stable foundation for development and a clear path to deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new Git repository is created.
2. The repository contains `frontend` and `backend` directories.
3. The `frontend` directory contains a basic React application.
4. The `backend` directory contains a basic Go application with an HTTP server.
5. The backend exposes a `/health` endpoint that returns a `200 OK` status.
6. A basic CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) is configured to run on every push.

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes
The following implementation guidance is extracted only from architecture documents. No assumptions beyond cited sources.

### Previous Story Insights
- No previous story. This is the first in the epic.

### Data Models
- No specific data models required for 1.1. User/Coffee/BrewLog models exist for later stories. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#user-model] [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#coffee-model] [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#brewlog-model]

### API Specifications
- For 1.1, only `/health` is required; broader API spec covers auth/users/coffees/brewlogs for later epics. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#api-organization] [Source: docs/architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md#health-checks] [Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md#user--authentication-endpoints]

### Component Specifications (Frontend)
- Initial pages and common components are defined; ensure `App` with Router and public routes (`/`, `/login`, `/signup`) exists. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#react-component-hierarchy] [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-strategy]

### File Locations / Project Structure
- Monorepo layout with `apps/frontend` and `apps/backend`; shared packages under `packages/`. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#monorepo-organization]
- Backend structure with `cmd/server/main.go`, `internal/api/{handlers,middleware,routes}`, `internal/config`, `internal/database`. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#go-package-structure]
- Frontend with `src/main.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/pages`, `src/components`, `src/context`. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#monorepo-organization]

### Technical Constraints
- Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript, Vite bundler, MUI + Emotion. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Backend: Go 1.22.x, `net/http` standard library for REST API. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

### Testing Requirements
- Follow testing pyramid; unit tests predominant, basic smoke tests acceptable for 1.1. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#testing-pyramid]
- Frontend: Jest + React Testing Library for component tests. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#frontend-testing]
- Backend: Go `testing` for unit/integration; include API test for `/health`. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#backend-testing]

### Security/Performance Notes
- None special for 1.1; add logging and structured error handling as code scaffolds later. [Source: docs/architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#logging-strategy]

### Project Structure Notes
- The defined structure aligns with the source tree; no conflicts found. If repo already conforms, this story validates presence and minimal functionality rather than creating anew. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#monorepo-organization]

## Testing
- Frontend: Add and run a basic render test for the root `App` to ensure the app boots without errors. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#frontend-testing]
- Backend: Add `/health` handler test returning 200 JSON payload; run via `go test`. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#backend-testing]

## QA Results

Review Summary:
- Scope: Monorepo setup, React app skeleton, Go HTTP server with /health, and basic CI pipeline.
- Depth: Standard review with targeted deep-dive due to backend test failures discovered in CI scope.

Gate Decision: CONCERNS
- Reason: Backend CI tests fail in the migrate package; core AC are implemented, frontend tests pass, and /health works as specified.

Requirements Traceability (AC → Evidence):
- AC1 (Git repo): Repository initialized; project under version control ('.git' present).
- AC2 (Frontend & Backend dirs): `apps/frontend` and `apps/backend` exist with expected structure.
- AC3 (Basic React app): Vite React TS app present; `App` and public routes; smoke test exists and passes.
- AC4 (Basic Go app/HTTP server): Server entrypoint at `apps/backend/cmd/server/main.go`; router configured; builds successfully (`go build ./...`).
- AC5 (/health endpoint 200): Route wired in `internal/api/routes/routes.go`; handler in `internal/api/handlers/health.go`; unit test `health_test.go` asserts 200 and payload.
- AC6 (CI/CD configured): GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs lint, build, and tests on push/PR.

Risk Assessment:
- Flags triggering deeper look: CI includes `go test ./...` which runs unrelated migrate tests, currently failing.
- Overall risk: Low-to-Medium for this story’s scope; main risk is CI instability from migrate package.

Test Architecture Assessment:
- Frontend: Vitest + RTL configured; single render test for `App` is appropriate at this stage.
- Backend: Handler-level test for `/health` is adequate for 1.1. Consider adding a router-level integration test using `httptest` in a future story.
- CI: Steps are correctly sequenced; however, backend tests include packages beyond this story’s scope.

Code Quality Notes:
- `HealthCheck` returns a hardcoded timestamp (non-blocking for 1.1). Consider using current time or omitting field until needed.
- Project structure aligns with architecture docs; separate Go module under `apps/backend` is correctly configured.

NFR Snapshot (for 1.1 scope):
- Security: N/A at this stage (no auth flows in scope).
- Performance: N/A (simple endpoint).
- Reliability: Basic handler and route in place; minimal surface.
- Maintainability: Code is readable; tests and CI present.

Testability Evaluation:
- Controllability: High (simple inputs; unit tests straightforward).
- Observability: High (JSON response; can assert status/payload).
- Debuggability: High (small surface, clear layering).

Technical Debt / Improvements:
- Backend CI instability due to migrate tests failing: migration runner naively splits SQL by semicolons; SQLite trigger statements contain internal semicolons, causing "incomplete input" and failures; also no `*.down.sql` present.
- Recommend either fixing the migration runner and adding proper `001_initial_schema.up.sql`/`001_initial_schema.down.sql`, or temporarily scoping CI tests to API packages until migrations are implemented in their dedicated story.

Recommendations:
- Must-fix before merging this story to main: Ensure backend CI is green by (a) adjusting CI to run only API handler/router tests for this story, OR (b) fixing migration tests (preferred if quick to address).
- Nice-to-have: Add a simple router integration test for `/health` using the configured mux router.

Suggested Next Status: Address concerns above, then Ready for Merge.

Evidence (local runs):
- Frontend tests: pass (`npm test --workspace=apps/frontend -- --run`).
- Backend build: pass (`cd apps/backend && go build ./...`).
- Backend tests: failing in `internal/migrate` (outside 1.1 scope).
