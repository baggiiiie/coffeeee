# Story 1.2: Database Setup & User Model

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a developer, I want to set up the SQLite database connection and introduce versioned migrations for the `users` table, so that user information can be stored and schema changes can be applied and rolled back reliably.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The Go backend can connect to a SQLite database file.
2. A database migration tool is added to the project.
3. A new migration is created for the `users` table with columns for `id`, `email`, `password_hash`, etc.
4. The migration can be applied and rolled back successfully.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement SQLite connection (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Ensure `apps/backend/internal/database/connection.go` initializes SQLite with WAL and foreign keys enabled [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#database-integration]
  - [ ] Confirm database file path and migrations path are configurable via `config.Database` (`DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_MIGRATIONS_PATH`) [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#configuration-management]
- [ ] Introduce versioned migrations runner (AC: 2, 4)
  - [ ] Add a simple migration runner under `apps/backend/cmd/migrate` to execute `*.up.sql` and `*.down.sql` in order, tracking versions in a `schema_migrations` table [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#migration-strategy]
  - [ ] Provide commands: `migrate up` (to latest), `migrate down` (one step), and `migrate to <version>` [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#migration-strategy]
  - [ ] Update `Makefile` with `db-migrate-up` and `db-migrate-down` targets [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#development-process]
- [ ] Create initial `users` table migration (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Add `apps/backend/migrations/001_users_table.up.sql` implementing the `users` schema per architecture [Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md#sqlite-schema-definition]
  - [ ] Add `apps/backend/migrations/001_users_table.down.sql` to drop the table and associated indexes/triggers [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#migration-strategy]
- [ ] Apply and verify migration (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Run `migrate up` locally to create `users`
  - [ ] Add a database test using in-memory SQLite to run `up` then `down`, verifying table presence/absence [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#database-testing]
- [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] Add brief usage notes to `README.md` for migration commands [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#development-process]

## Dev Notes
The following guidance is extracted only from architecture documents and existing repo structure.

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.1 established the monorepo, React + Vite frontend, Go backend, health endpoint, and basic CI. This story builds on that foundation by enabling persistent storage and schema management.

### Data Models
- User model fields and constraints to reflect in schema: `ID`, `Username`, `Email` (unique), `PasswordHash`, `PasswordSalt`, `CreatedAt`, `UpdatedAt`. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#user-model]

### Database Schema
- SQLite schema for `users` is defined, including unique indexes for `email` and `username`, timestamp columns, and an `updated_at` trigger. Use these definitions for the migration SQL. [Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md#sqlite-schema-definition]
- Data integrity constraints: uniqueness on username/email; enforce via indexes in migration. [Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md#data-integrity-constraints]

### Backend Integration
- Use SQLite 3.x for the MVP; Go 1.22 with the standard library. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Database integration emphasizes connection pooling, transactions, and enabling foreign keys; WAL mode recommended. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#database-integration]
- Migration strategy requires version-controlled schema changes and rollback capabilities; implement a runner to execute up/down SQL files. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#migration-strategy]

### API Specifications
- No new API endpoints are required for this story; database setup is internal. Future auth/user endpoints are defined elsewhere. [Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md#user--authentication-endpoints]

### File Locations / Project Structure
- Monorepo layout and backend folder locations: `apps/backend/{cmd,internal,migrations}`. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#monorepo-organization]
- Relevant files and paths in this repo: `apps/backend/internal/database/connection.go`, `apps/backend/cmd/setup/main.go`, `apps/backend/migrations/`. Ensure new migration runner lives under `apps/backend/cmd/migrate`. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#go-package-structure]

### Testing Requirements
- Follow the testing pyramid; implement database tests using in-memory SQLite and migration runner. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#testing-pyramid] [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#database-testing]
- Backend unit/integration tests via Go `testing`. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#backend-testing]

### Technical Constraints
- Tech stack: Go 1.22.x, SQLite 3.x, REST backend with `net/http`. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Config-driven database URL and migrations path; expose via environment variables. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#configuration-management]

### Project Structure Notes
- The architecture prescribes a migration strategy (versioned with rollback). The repo currently includes a one-off setup program that executes a single SQL file; extend to a versioned up/down runner to align with architecture. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#migration-strategy]

## Testing
- Add Go tests to validate `migrate up` creates `users` and `migrate down` removes it using an in-memory SQLite database. [Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md#database-testing]
- Ensure connection settings enable `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` and `PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL` before running migrations. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#database-integration]
