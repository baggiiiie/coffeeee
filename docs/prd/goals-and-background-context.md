# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
*   Create an engaging web application that makes learning about coffee fun and accessible for both beginners and enthusiasts.
*   Develop a core set of MVP features, including pour-over guides, AI-assisted brew logs, a coffee journey log, and an AI recommendation engine.
*   Launch the MVP within 6 months as a one-person project.
*   Provide a solid foundation for future development, including expanded brewing methods, community features, and native mobile apps.

## Background Context
This project was initiated to address the problem that learning about specialty coffee is often a frustrating and intimidating experience. The current landscape of online resources is fragmented and lacks a structured, engaging learning path, which can cause enthusiasts to lose the joy of their hobby.

The "Coffeeee" app aims to solve this by providing a centralized, fun, and interactive platform for coffee education. This Product Requirements Document (PRD) will build upon the foundational Project Brief to define the specific functional and non-functional requirements for the development of the MVP.
