# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The user experience should be clean, calming, and encouraging. It should feel like a beautiful, well-crafted tool that is a pleasure to use. The design should be minimalist, with a focus on typography and visual clarity, avoiding clutter. The tone should be supportive and friendly, making the user feel like they have a companion on their coffee journey.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
*   **Guided Flows:** Key tasks, like logging a new brew, will be broken down into simple, step-by-step processes to avoid overwhelming the user.
*   **Progressive Disclosure:** The app will only show information as it's needed, keeping the interface clean and focused.
*   **Clear Visual Feedback:** The app will provide clear and immediate feedback for user actions.

## Core Screens and Views
This is a conceptual list of the essential screens needed for the MVP:
*   **Dashboard/Home:** A central hub to see recent activity and start common tasks.
*   **Brewing Guides:** A library of the pour-over guides.
*   **Brew Log Form:** A dedicated screen for logging a new brew.
*   **Coffee Gallery:** A visual log of all the coffees a user has tried.
*   **Coffee Detail Page:** A view of a specific coffee and its brew history.
*   **User Profile & Settings:** A simple page for account management.

## Accessibility
*   **WCAG AA:** This is a standard for accessibility that ensures the app is usable by people with disabilities. I've assumed this is a good starting point.

## Branding
*   *Assumption:* Since we don't have a brand yet, I'm assuming a clean, modern aesthetic with a warm and inviting color palette (e.g., earthy tones) that reflects the craft of specialty coffee.

## Target Device and Platforms
*   **Web Responsive:** As we decided earlier, the app must work beautifully on both desktop and mobile web browsers.
