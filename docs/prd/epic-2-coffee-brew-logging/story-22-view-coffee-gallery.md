# Story 2.2: View Coffee Gallery
*   **As a** logged-in user,
*   **I want** to see all the coffees I have logged in a visually appealing gallery,
*   **so that** I can easily browse my coffee history.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The dashboard links to a "My Coffees" page.
    2.  The "My Coffees" page displays a grid of cards, each showing the photo and name of a logged coffee.
    3.  Clicking on a coffee card navigates the user to the detail page for that coffee.
