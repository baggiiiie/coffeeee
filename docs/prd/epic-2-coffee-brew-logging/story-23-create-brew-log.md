# Story 2.3: Create Brew Log
*   **As a** logged-in user,
*   **I want** to start a new brew log for a specific coffee from my collection,
*   **so that** I can record the details of my brew.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The Coffee Detail Page has a "Log New Brew" button.
    2.  The "Log New Brew" page has input fields for all the required brewing parameters (grind size, water temp, ratio, etc.).
    3.  The backend has an endpoint to create a new brew log entry, associated with the specific coffee.
    4.  Upon saving, the user is redirected back to the Coffee Detail Page.
