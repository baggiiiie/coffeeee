# Story 2.4 (Revised): AI-Guided Tasting Experience
*   **As a** logged-in user,
*   **I want** the app to ask me guiding questions about what I'm tasting,
*   **so that** I can learn to identify and describe the flavors in my coffee myself.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The tasting notes section of the "Log New Brew" page has an "AI Tasting Guide" button.
    2.  When clicked, the AI guide initiates an interactive, step-by-step process.
    3.  The guide asks a series of questions to prompt the user to think about specific aspects of the taste (e.g., "First, let's focus on the sweetness. Do you taste more of a fruit sweetness, like apple, or more of a sugar sweetness, like honey?").
    4.  Based on the user's answers (e.g., clicking on "Fruit Sweetness"), the guide might ask a follow-up question (e.g., "Great. Is that a crisp fruit like an apple, or a soft fruit like a peach?").
    5.  The user's answers are used to help them build their own tasting notes; the app facilitates their description rather than generating it for them.
    6.  The process is designed to be educational, teaching the user the vocabulary and methodology of coffee tasting in an interactive way.
