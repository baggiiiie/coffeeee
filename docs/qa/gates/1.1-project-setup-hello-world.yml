    severity: medium
    finding: "Backend `go test ./...` fails in migrate package due to naive SQL splitting and missing down migration."
    suggested_action: "Add proper 001_initial_schema.up.sql/down.sql and update runner to handle statements with internal semicolons (e.g., triggers), or scope CI tests to API packages until migrations are implemented."
  - id: "API-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "HealthCheck uses hardcoded timestamp."
    suggested_action: "Use current time or omit until needed."

  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Stabilize backend CI by fixing migrate tests or scoping test run."
    monitor:
      - "Refine health payload semantics later; keep handler minimal."
