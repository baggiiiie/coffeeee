status_reason: "Migration runner naively splits SQL by ';', breaking SQLite trigger BEGIN...END blocks; 'up' fails with incomplete input, so apply/rollback not proven."

top_issues:
  - id: "DBMIG-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Up migration fails due to naive SQL splitting; CREATE TRIGGER requires atomic BEGIN...END."
    suggested_action: "Execute scripts without naive splitting for sqlite3 or implement a parser that respects BEGIN...END/comments/strings. Add tests for triggers."
  - id: "MIG-STRUCT-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Stray '001_initial_schema.sql' alongside .up/.down files can confuse conventions."
    suggested_action: "Remove or convert to versioned up/down files to keep a single convention."

risk_summary:
  totals: { critical: 0, high: 1, medium: 0, low: 1 }
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Fix migration runner splitting and re-run tests to validate AC4."
    monitor:
      - "Normalize migrations naming to avoid drift."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security features introduced in this story."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "SQLite runner overhead minimal; no performance impact."
  reliability:
    status: FAIL
    notes: "Runner cannot apply trigger-containing migrations; breaks reliability of schema management."
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Naive splitter is brittle; add tests and robust parsing to reduce future breakage."
